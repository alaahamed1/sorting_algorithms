This for  `0x1B.C-Sorting algorithms & Big O`  project:

Description for all the files and directories in this directory Any file that does't have a description -if there is any- is propably for testing purposes

`sort.h`  -> a header file for this project

`print_array.c`  -> a source code file for a function that prints an array of integers

-   Prototype:  `void print_array(const int *array, size_t size);`

`print_list.c`  -> -> a source code file for a function that prints a list of integers

-   Prototype:  `void print_list(const listint_t *list)`

`0-bubble_sort.c`  -> a source code file for a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

-   Prototype:  `void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
-   It is expected to print the array after each time the two elements swap

`0-O`  -> the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

-   in the best case
-   in the average case
-   in the worst case

`1-insertion_sort_list.c`  -> a source code file for a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm

-   Prototype:  `void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);`
-   You are not allowed to modify the integer n of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.
-   You’re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

`1-O`  -> the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

-   in the best case
-   in the average case
-   in the worst case

`2-selection_sort.c`  -> a source code file for a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm

-   Prototype:  `void selection_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
-   You’re expected to print the  `array`  after each time you swap two elements

`2-O`  -> the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

-   in the best case
-   in the average case
-   in the worst case

`3-quick_sort.c`  -> a source code file for a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm

-   Prototype:  `void quick_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
-   You must implement the Lomuto partition scheme.
-   The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.
-   You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements

`3-O`  the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

-   in the best case
-   in the average case
-   in the worst case
